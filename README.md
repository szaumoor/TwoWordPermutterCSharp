## TwoWordPermutter
This is a small utility I wrote semi-seriously to generate cool usernames by reading a file containing the words and finding all the possible combinations of two words.

## How to use
Download the exe in the releases section. Execute it. It will ask you to point to a valid text file to take as input, and then to the number of maximum character permitted in permutations. If all is valid, it will be generated in the working directory, which will fbe named as the original file plus "__output.txt".
See input.txt for an example of a valid input file, and output.txt to see the result of an execution.
